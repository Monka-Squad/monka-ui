# Monka UI

A React component library developed by the Monka Squad.

## Quickstart

```
yarn install
yarn storybook
```

## Storybook

Storybook is a library for previewing collections of components, and is used to view each of the Monka UI components during development. To start Storybook, run `yarn storybook`.

See [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) for an intro on writing Stories.

## Testing

Run `yarn test` to run the Jest test sweet for each component. Find component tests in the `__test__` folder in each component folder.
